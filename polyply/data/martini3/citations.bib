abstract={The coarse-grained Martini force field is widely used in biomolecular simulations. Here we present the refined model, Martini 3 (http://cgmartini.nl), with an improved interaction balance, new bead types and expanded ability to include specific interactions representing, for example, hydrogen bonding and electronic polarizability. The updated model allows more accurate predictions of molecular packing and interactions in general, which is exemplified with a vast and diverse set of applications, ranging from oil/water partitioning and miscibility data to complex molecular systems, involving protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions and material science applications as ionic liquids and aedamers.},

  abstract={Poly(para-phenylene ethynylene)s, or short PPEs, are a class of conjugated and semi-flexible polymers with a strongly delocalized π electron system and increased chain stiffness. Due to this, PPEs have a wide range of technological applications. Although the material properties of single-chains or mixtures of few PPE chains have been studied in detail, the properties of large assemblies remain to be fully explored. Here, we developed a coarse-grained model for PPEs with the Martini 3 force field to enable computational studies of PPEs in large-scale assembly. We used an optimization geometrical approach to take the shape of the π conjugated backbone into account and also applied an additional angular potential to tune the mechanical bending stiffness of the polymer. Our Martini 3 model reproduces key structural and thermodynamic observables of single PPE chains and mixtures, such as persistence length, density, packing and stacking. We show that chain entanglement increases with the expense of nematic ordering with growing PPE chain length. With the Martini 3 PPE model at hand, we are now able to cover large spatio-temporal scales and thereby to uncover key aspects for the structural organization of PPE bulk systems. The model is also predicted to be of high applicability to investigate out-of-equilibrium behavior of PPEs under mechanical force.}
